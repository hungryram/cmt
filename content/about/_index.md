**Hi I’m Corinne!**

I aim to create a safe environment while tailoring you’re session to your specific needs. I am a Neuromuscular Massage Therapist which means I re-educate your muscles to it’s natural resting point. It’s what I like to call the “Real Work” not the “Fake/Fluffy Work”.  
I also offer other modalities such as Swedish, Deep Tissue, Trigger Point, Myofascial Techniques, Sports Massage, etc.

​

Here is a little more about me...

​

I am a graduate from the 900 hour program at National Holistic Institute. I am educated in both Western and Eastern modalities. During my education at National Holistic Institute, I was required to work in the teaching clinic which gave me the experience of working on the public as well as reception desk responsibilities which included customer service, cashier, record keeping, appointment scheduling, and problem solving. Some of my experience was developed during my externship at Hand and Stone Spa and Facial. At Hand and Stone, I would perform massages and complete the responsibilities of a massage therapist which included laundry and turning rooms. While I was still in training, I volunteered as a Massage Therapist to do the 2017 Disneyland Half Marathon Race in Anaheim. Volunteering at this event gave me the experience of performing Sports Massage on participating athletes. After graduating from the 900 hour program at NHI, I knew there had to be more to learn in order to relieve the body from pain. That is when I decided to take the 450 hour Advanced Neuromuscular Massage Therapy Program at NHI. During This program I studied what I like to call the "Real Work" rather than the "Fluffy Work". Currently, I am a Dance Teacher/Dancer/Choreographer in OC/LA area and I help relieve pain through Travel Massage Therapy. Because of my training at National Holistic Institute, I am proud to be a Professional Massage Therapist and Health Educator. I believe that the body needs assistance in healing whether it’s through body rehabilitation or simple relaxation. I look forward to working with you and can’t wait to help you with wellness journey!
