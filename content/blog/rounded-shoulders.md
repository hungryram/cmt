Here is an exercise to help open those shoulders!

But first... lets learn some minor details about the muscle we are targeting.

**Infraspinatus**  
_- Part of the rotator cuff_

_- External rotation_

_- Lays on top (posterior) of the scapula_

GREAT! Now let's get to the exercise.

1. Make sure you are using either a Light-Med band or if you’re at your gym, use the cables with little to no weight as I did here... remember this is a small muscle, but when trained correctly, it makes a huge difference.
2. Lock in your scapula - pinch both shoulder blades together and downward. You want your scapula pinned against the ribcage rather than winged out or relaxed.
3. Take your below to 90 degree angle.
4. Keep your elbow attached to your body or use a towel in between your forearm and your body to help keep your Infraspinatus activated.
5. Slowly open all the way and close back. You are externally rotating that rotator cuff.
