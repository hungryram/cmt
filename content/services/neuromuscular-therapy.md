Neuromuscular Therapy is used for clients with chronic pain as it can reduce or even eliminate persistent painful conditions. Many techniques can also be used to treat acute injuries and post-surgical care. Some clients even use this therapy to help to improve performance in sport or dance and to prevent injuries due to these activities.

Neuromuscular Therapy treatment starts with a complete examination of pain and dysfunction throughout the body which may include client history and functional testing. It is then followed by bodywork treatment that is specific to your treatment plan.
