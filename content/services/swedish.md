Swedish Massage is relaxing, therapeutic, and what I like to call "The Fluffy Work" type of bodywork. It uses oils or lotion with long gliding strokes and many other techniques such as kneading, rolling, and percussion which helps improve body circulation. Benefits may include pain relief, decreased stress levels, enhances mental clarity, increased circulation, and enhanced flexibility.
