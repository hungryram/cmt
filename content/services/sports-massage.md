Sports Massage aims to enhance your athletic performance and reduce risk of injury by stretching tight muscles, stimulating inactive muscles, and improving soft tissue imbalances. It can reduce muscle pain and soreness while increasing flexibility and recovery speed from injuries. Some techniques used in this massage involve stretching, compression and rocking. Depending on the type of outcome you would like  from your sports massage session, deep tissue techniques can be used.

There are usually 2 sessions. Pre-Sports Massage and Post-Sports Massage. People often book this type of massage before, during, or after an athletic event or workout. NO DEEP TISSUE will be performed during these types of sessions as it can damage, strain, or shock your muscles.

There are some occasions where someone may book a sports massage on their non-active day for just the benefits and different techniques used. YES, DEEP TISSUE can be used during this type of session.
